Chef, is a native android mobile application developed with Java. 

A project that helps the Employer to manage his team members, their salaries, their working time where everything is linked and relative.
He can also save his bills, organize his tasks and consult his employees data such as phone number, email, etc..

In this app I focused on implementing custom adapters in order to have an easy and customized ListView which contains different types of data.

I also worked on SQLITE (local database) and learned how to manage it in an efficient way.
